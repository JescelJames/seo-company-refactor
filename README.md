# My First Challenge: 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Description

This is my first coding challenge using GitHub, Git Bash, Visual Studio Code, and working with repositories!

- My motivation:  To build an application for my work after completing this class.
- Why I took this challege: I was not familiar with semantics and the importance of codes that are easier to read.
- What the challenge solved:  It created a way to easily understand the layout of the index codes.  It also cleaned up some styling.
- What I learned:  I learned the importance of semantics, cleanliness, and ease of reading. I also learned how to use Git Bash basic commands. In addition, I learned how to create an SSH key.  Finally, I learned how to repositories work locally and remotely and how they can interact with each other.
